Hi Ankit,

As discussed on LinkedIn, here is the exercise.

We want to time bound this to 4h, so it remains reasonable.

To do so, I'd like you to first let me know if the requirements make sense, and if you think you can build something in that time frame. If not, what should we leave out?

Also, I do not expect you to put too much effort on the UI, but I am expecting some visual feedback on user actions.

Code delivery could be made through github or similar, or a zip archive. I expect the deliverable in about 2 days from now.


Build a ReactJS app that:
1- let a user search the Gutendex library for books https://gutendex.com/
2- display the results in a way they can be sorted, and paginated
3- let the user select books from the results and add them to their shortlist
4- display the shortlist
5- persist the shortlist so that the user can see it again the next time he fires his browser and go back to the app


Let me know if you have questions.
